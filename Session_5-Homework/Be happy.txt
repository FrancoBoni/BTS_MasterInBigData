Here is a little song I wroteYou might want to sing it note for noteDon't worry be happyIn every life we have some troubleWhen you worry you make it doubleDon't worry, be happyAin't got no place to lay your headSomebody came and took your bedDon't worry, be happyThe land lord say your rent is lateHe may have to litigateDon't worry, be happyLook at me I am happyDon't worry, be happyHere I give you my phone numberWhen you worry call meI make you happyDon't worry, be happyAin't got no cash, ain't got no styleAin't got no girl to make you smileBut don't worry be happyCause when you worryYour face will frownAnd that will bring everybody downSo don't worry, be happy (now)There is this little song I wrote
I hope you learn it note for note
Like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Listen to what I say
In your life expect some trouble
But when you worry
You make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass
Whatever it is
Don't worry, be happy
